# Obstacle-Avoidance-Reinforcement-Learning
This repository contains the code for training an agent to navigate through a simulated environment toward a designated target while avoiding dynamic obstacles. The aim of this project is to explore the effectiveness of reinforcement learning techniques in solving navigation tasks. We aim to investigate how well the agent can learn to navigate.
