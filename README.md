# Exploring the Potential of the PPO Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Efficient Navigation with Obstacle Avoidance
This repository contains the code for training an agent to navigate through a simulated environment toward a designated target while avoiding dynamic obstacles. The aim of this project is to explore the effectiveness of reinforcement learning techniques in solving navigation tasks. We aim to investigate how well the agent can learn to navigate.
- Please refer to main.pdf for a detailed explanation of the project and its implementation.
- To view the results of how trained agent is behaving in the each environment of discrete and continuous cases, please watch the videos available at the following link: https://iitgnacin-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/kumar_rajesh_iitgn_ac_in1/EhW5MIp7TgBHkHUi7lZ9LUoB3-qcE4iLsraAr2vdxlFACA?e=tLwOX9
